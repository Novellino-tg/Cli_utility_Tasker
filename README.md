## Cli_utility_Tasker

Just implemented a simple to-do app that maintains list of tasks and runs on commandline which can be used to add new tasks to be done, delete tasks and also lists all tasks in the list. Implemented with the help of npm packages chalk and figlet to enhance the look and feel in commandline.
